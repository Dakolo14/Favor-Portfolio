            I am a Nigerian freelance 2D animator, motion specialist, and graphic designer.<br /><br />
            Giving life to ideas with animation and design is my passion.<br /><br />
            I'm always learning, experimenting, and combining different styles, techniques, and approaches. Animation is like solving a puzzleâ€”trying different options until you get that spark that brings everything to life. Once you see the whole picture come together, you can't help but replay it with a big smile.<br /><br />
            After earning my degree in design, I started my career as a freelancer, working with clients to bring their visions to life.<br /><br />
            When I'm not creating animations, I love playing video games and watching anime for inspiration.
